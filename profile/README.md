## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ We are the Quantitative Forestry research group of the [iuFOR - University Institute on Sustainable Forest Management Research](https://iufor.uva.es/)

💻 On this GitHub organization we have some interesting information:

- The code of some growth models programmed for the old SIMANFOR version can be found [here](https://github.com/iuFOR-QuantitativeForestry/SiManFor-Models)
- Some results about the GO-SIGCA project can be found [here](https://github.com/iuFOR-QuantitativeForestry/report.go_sigca)
- The results of different simulations using SIMANFOR for the Cross-Forest project can be found [here](https://github.com/iuFOR-QuantitativeForestry/CrossForest-simulations)
- Some results about the COMFOR-SUDOE project can be found [here](https://github.com/iuFOR-QuantitativeForestry/COMFOR.NFI)
- During the course 2021/2022 we develop some cheatsheets of different topics on the project VirtualForests available [here](https://github.com/iuFOR-QuantitativeForestry/VirtualForests_cheatsheets)
- On November 2022 we published a book about the adaptation of forestry species to climate change in Castilla y León (Spain). The code to develop the climate graphs is available [here](https://github.com/iuFOR-QuantitativeForestry/AdaptaCyL-clima)

🔗 Apart from that, we own other repositories that can be interesting for you:

- ✨ [SMART Global Ecosystems](https://github.com/SMART-Global-Ecosystems) is a Chair that we own joint with [Sngular](https://www.sngular.com/). More information [here](https://smartglobalecosystems.uva.es/)
- 📚 [GEODATA](https://github.com/GEODATA-UVa) has the code contents of our micro-credential to interact with students. You can find more information in [here](https://geodata.uva.es/)
- 🌳 SIMANFOR is a tool developed for our group. It is a Decision Support System for the Simulation of Sustainable Forest Management Alternatives available at his [website](https://www.simanfor.es/), which support information is available at the [simanfor GitHub](https://github.com/simanfor)
